      "I survived, I’m stunning, and I am READY for my comeback next week!",
      "Thank the fashion gods, because I was NOT prepared for that lip sync life!",

      "Whew, that was close! Next week? No more near-misses!",
      "My heart almost jumped out of my couture gown, but I’m still here!",
      "Dodging a lip sync is just another skill in my fashion toolkit!"

      "This is NOT the punchline I was hoping for!",

      "Alright, time to throw these heels on and give the performance of a LIFETIME!",

      "I’m safe, and you know what that means? Time to sit back and enjoy the show!",
      "I may not be the star of the night, but at least I’m still in the cast!",
      "Avoiding elimination is almost as satisfying as landing the perfect joke!",

      "Safe? Fine. But next time, I expect nothing less than a WIN!",
      "I may have slipped, but I’m still standing—and still STUNNING!",
      "This was a wake-up call, and next week? I am RECLAIMING my throne!",
